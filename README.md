# Hi there! I'm Andrea Guarneri 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about **front-end development** and am currently focused on honing my skills in **JavaScript** through hands-on projects and exercises. Here, you’ll find a showcase of my journey in coding, problem-solving, and experimenting with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## 💻 What I’m Currently Working On

I’m building a solid foundation in JavaScript by working on real-world solutions and adopting a professional approach to code. Below is one of the key projects I’m actively working on:

## 🌇 Time-Based Greetings with JavaScript & Tailwind CSS 🌞🌜

This project offers dynamic greetings based on the time of day. Users input the time of day ("day", "afternoon", or "night"), and the page responds by changing its background color, displaying a matching image, and showing a relevant greeting message—all powered by **JavaScript** and **Tailwind CSS**.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **User Prompt**: The page prompts users to specify the time of day (day, afternoon, night) via `prompt()`.
- **Dynamic Page Update**: Background color, image, and greeting text update based on the user’s input.
- **Error Handling**: If the user provides an invalid input, an error message and fallback image are displayed.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: The project leverages Tailwind CSS to create a clean, responsive design using utility-first classes.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Backgrounds and images are changed dynamically based on the time of day.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Skills

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Writing modular, clean code while practicing key concepts.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Building structured, accessible, and responsive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizing utility-first CSS for efficient and rapid UI development.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically altering page elements and styles based on user interactions.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing user-friendly error messages and fallback designs.

Feel free to clone, explore, and provide feedback on any of my projects! Each one represents a step in my journey to becoming a skilled front-end developer.
